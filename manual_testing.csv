6325,8411,Will the Media Reset After the Election or Are We Stuck With This Tabloid Stuff?,written by peter van buren   venerable new york times ran a story saying donald trump lies about the height of his buildings for no apparent reason  the times resurrected some information from  saying trump insisted on counting the basement levels of his signature trump tower in the overall count of how many floors the building has  the times compares this lie to  reports  that trump adds an inch to his actual body height in his bio materials  and also repeated the gag line that he boasted about how long his penis is  no word on whether it is or is not actually longer than expected  you have to wade down to paragraph  to learn other new york developers use the same count the basements levels gimmick to be able to advertise their buildings as taller  there is absolutely no news  the russians head over to slate   which published an  investigative piece  alleging a trump computer server was secretly communicating with a russian bank  the story had previously been debunked by the new york times and the intercept  but slate ran it as if they had uncovered the smoking gun proving trump is under the control of the russians at mother jones   another article alleged that an anonymous  former intelligence officer provided the fbi with information on a russian scheme to help trump win the presidency  there s no way to tell whether the fbi has confirmed or debunked any of the allegations contained in the former spy s memos   the story said   but a russian intelligence attempt to co opt or cultivate a presidential candidate would mark an even more serious operation than the hacking  one more example  from vox   which wrote without even bothering to source it at all  there is basically conclusive evidence that russia is interfering in the us election  and that this interference has been designed to damage hillary clinton s campaign  there is strong evidence linking trump s foreign policy advisers to russia  and trump s stated policy ideas are extremely favorable to russian interests   journalism much  i ve chosen these examples because they are from publications that have in the past enjoyed decent reputations for reporting  and because these stories were run as  news   not opinion columns  where the standards go right through the floor  even mother jones  which clearly works left of center  used to do so with some solid journalism not any more these places  never find fringe publications  are now working with the same standards once reserved for reporting on aliens at roswell  elvis sightings and the illuminati new world order  it is apparently now within the bounds of mainstream journalism to build a story out of  well  nothing  such as a factoid from   or essentially accuse a presidential candidate of treason based on a single  anonymous source  or claim the russians have taken over our electoral process based on no sources at all  and clinton  on the other side  reporting on clinton by many of these same publications swerves between hagiography and poo pooing away anything unfavorable  emails  who cares  questions about what her accomplishments as secretary of state really were  if you ask  you hate women  pay for play with the clinton foundation  hah  everybody does it  it doesn t matter  the standard seems to be absent a notarized receipt for a donation matching an arms sale  or a criminal conviction  nothing matters  next  so be it  the media has fully sh t the bed this election  that s where we find ourselves but what s next  will the media reset itself after november   or will they run president trump is putin s dog stories for the full term  will president clinton be given a pass on  well  everything  for four years  with apologists and explainers on the front page of the times  never mind in editorials at what point will the media dig themselves out of this and start real reporting again  reprinted with permission from wemeantwell com   related,0

6329,8737,Assange claims ‘crazed’ Clinton campaign tried to hack WikiLeaks,julian assange has claimed the hillary clinton campaign has attacked the servers being used by wikileaks  despite the ecuadorian embassy shutting down his internet until the us election is over  the website will continue publishing  according to assange   everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict   assange said via telephone at a conference in argentina on wednesday  the whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from clinton s campaign chair  john podesta  on a daily basis since early october  assange claimed the release  whipped up a crazed hornet s nest atmosphere in the hillary clinton campaign  leading them to attack wikileaks    they attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the un and british courts to accuse me of being both a russian spy and a pedophile   he added  ecuador s decision to shut down his internet was described by assange as a  strategic position  so that its  policy of non intervention can t be misinterpreted by actors in the us and even domestically in ecuador    he said he was sympathetic with ecuador  insisting they face the dilemma of having the us interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the us elections next month  assange  who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference  said he did not agree with ecuador s decision but did understand it  wikileaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from ecuador  he said  he did  however  reject the idea that wikileaks is interfering with the us election  claiming   this is not the interference of electoral process  this is the definition of electoral process   for media organizations and  in fact  everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring  it cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform    he also attacked us tv networks  many of whom he accused of being  controlled by clinton supporters    the podesta emails will make no difference to the election result  according to assange   i don t think there s any chance of donald trump winning the election  even with the amazing material we are publishing  because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with hillary clinton   he said  assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view trump as representing  what in their mind is white trash      source  rt news ,0
6330,4490,State Department says it can't find emails from Clinton IT specialist,the state department told the republican national committee that it could not find any emails to or from hillary clinton s former it specialist  who managed her private email server during her tenure as secretary of state before going on to work for the agency  according to a court filing made public monday     the government s revelation in u s  district court in washington came in answer to a lawsuit by the republican national committee  the rnc had sued over its public records request for all work related emails sent to or received by clinton s former aide  bryan pagliano  between  and   the years of clinton s tenure as america s top diplomat  the lawsuit also pressed for other state department records from the clinton era   the rnc s filing said lawyers for the agency had informed them in discussions that  the state department has represented that no responsive records exist  for any pagliano emails  pagliano was hired at the agency after reportedly setting up clinton s server in   but the lack of any official state department emails raises the question whether he limited his email traffic using a private account  much like clinton did during her four years as secretary  or whether his government emails were deleted     a state department official said monday that the agency possessed emails from pagliano from the period after clinton s term had ended  when he continued to work as a technology contractor   agency spokeswoman elizabeth trudeau then added monday evening that some pagliano emails dating from clinton s tenure had been recovered from agency officials  files and turned over to other organizations  including senate investigators      we have previously produced through foia and to congress emails sent and received by mr  pagliano during secretary clinton s tenure   trudeau said in a public statement  at least one email  which was sent in november  to clinton from pagliano    but possibly from his private email address    was released as part of   clinton emails made public by the agency over the past year     a spokesman for the rnc said the organization stood by its description of the discussions with lawyers for the state department  the group said in its filing that  the state department has represented that no responsive records exist      raj shah  the rnc spokesman  added   it s hard to believe that an it staffer who set up hillary clinton s reckless email server never sent or received a single work related email in the four years he worked at the state department   clinton s campaign officials declined to comment in response to questions from the associated press     trudeau said the state department is working with congress and several public records requesters to provide relevant material  she also said agency officials continue to search for  mr  pagliano s emails  which the department may have otherwise retained   trudeau also said the department would respond further to the rnc in court     state department officials told senate investigators last year they could not find a file containing pagliano s work emails during clinton s tenure  an assertion first reported by politico     fox news reported in march that pagliano has revealed several details about clinton s personal email system to investigators  including who had access to it  as well as when and what devices were used  an intelligence source close to the case told fox news that pagliano has been a  devastating witness  to clinton   the one email sent by pagliano that surfaced among clinton s   emails was sent to clinton was a november  birthday greeting  he wished her  happy birthday madam secretary  to many more      pagliano s email address was censored  unlike numerous official state department addresses that are listed in clinton s emails    suggesting he may have sent the message from a private address   clinton did not reply directly to pagliano  instead  she sent a copy of an email to an aide with the instruction  pls respond        the associated press contributed to this report ,1
6331,8062,The ‘P’ in PBS Should Stand for ‘Plutocratic’ or ‘Pentagon’,the  p  in pbs should stand for  plutocratic  or  pentagon  posted on oct      wikimedia    in a television commercial that the public broadcasting system  pbs  ran for years   pbs newshour  host gwen ifill declared that she loved her job because it allowed her to  ask not only all of my questions but also and more importantly all of your questions    this assertion was and remains absurd  just like her network s regular fundraising claim to be free of corporate sponsors   the claim has long been contradicted by the string of corporate image commercials  purchased by leading financial  defense  auto  insurance and rail corporations  that appear before the network s nightly  newshour  broadcast along with a list of corporate sponsored foundations and superwealthy individuals who pay for the show  along with  regular viewers like you    consistent with those commercials and despite its name  the news and commentary one finds on pbs is in rich tune with the narrow capitalist parameters of acceptable coverage and debate that typify the more fully and explicitly for profit and commercialized corporate media  as progressive journalist david sirota suggested two years ago   reflecting on recent investigations showing that supermoneyed  right wing capitalists such as the koch brothers and texas billionaire john arnold had  along with more liberal software mogul bill gates  influenced pbs content through multimillion dollar donations  the  p  in pbs often seems to more properly stand for  plutocratic   not  public    advertisement square  site wide  none of this should be surprising to anyone familiar with the distinctively big business dominated history of u s  broadcast media   because the united states fails to provide anything like adequate funding for public broadcasting  both pbs and national public radio  a regular vehicle for neoliberal business ideology  depend upon foundations  corporations and wealthy individuals to pay for much of their programming  beneath their standard claims to have no interest in shaping public media content  these private funders have bottom line agendas  meaning that their contributions come with strings attached strings that undermine the integrity of the  independent  journalism they bankroll   for what it s worth  between  and   the  newshour  was primarily owned by the for profit firm liberty media   liberty media was run by the conservative and politically active billionaire john malone  who had a majority stake in macneil lehrer productions  the show s producer    the pentagon broadcasting system   what might seem more surprising  perhaps  is the remarkable extent to which the  p  in pbs often seems to stand for  pentagon   or perhaps  presidential   when it comes to foreign policy content  whatever the global issue of the day or week   newshour  anchors and their invited  experts  can be counted on to report and reflect in accord with the doctrinal assumption that washington always operates with the best of intentions  they almost uniformly treat the u s  as a great  benevolent and indispensable force for freedom  democracy  security  peace and order in a dangerous world full of evil and deadly actors   the show s invited commentators are drawn primarily from the nation s imperial establishment  they are commonly current or retired insiders from within the pentagon  the white house  the  intelligence community  and or the nation s elite network of foreign policy think tanks  the council on foreign relations  the granddaddy of all u s  ruling class think tanks    the carnegie endowment for international peace  the aspen institute  the atlantic council  the rand corp  and the hoover institution  to name a handful   newshour  anchors and guests generally agree that the united states  officially designated enemies are malevolent bad guys who need to be contained  controlled and even attacked by the ultimate good guy  uncle sam   not surprisingly  the long and ongoing record of u s  imperial arrogance and criminality  more on that below  is swept down george orwell s memory hole even as new entries are added to the ugly registry  when reported by the  newshour   horrific crimes committed by the u s  military are always treated as well intended mistakes  along with the rest of the mainstream u s  media  the  newshour   insist that russia deliberately bombs hospitals  etc   whereas if we do it  it is  of course  an accident     there s some room for disagreement between and among the show s invited experts including the show s semi loopy foreign policy authority  margaret warner about specific u s  foreign policy tactics  strategies and actions  there s no space for serious debate about the immorality  lawlessness or imperial nature of that policy  on the rare occasions  newshour  anchors seem to challenge guests from the white house or pentagon on foreign policy matters  it is generally to ask why the u s  isn t going harder at the officially certified bad guys   america as umpire  not empire  the foreign policy coverage and commentary doesn t get much better in the documentary division of pbs  a recent documentary  first aired nationally last week  shown by pbs bears the risible title  american umpire  an obvious world series season play on what the filmmakers see as the preposterous notion of an american empire  it is narrated by ex marine and former  newshour  host and producer jim lehrer  developed by the right wing hoover institution and  targeted for pbs   the organization s own revealing phrase    american umpire  takes the doctrinal  american exceptionalist   u s  good and civilized rest of world dangerous and bad narrative to absurd lengths   it provides extensive  expert  commentary from such former imperial operatives as madeline albright  the onetime u s  secretary of state who led the charge to criminally bomb serbia and who went on cbs    minutes  to say that the death of more than half a million iraqi children killed by washington led  economic sanctions  was  a price worth paying  for the advance of u s  foreign policy goals   condoleezza rice  george w  bush s neoconservative national security adviser before and during the arch criminal u s  invasion of iraq   gen  jim  mad dog  mattis  an iraq invasion commander and a former chief of the u s  central command  who two years ago told a san diego audience that  it s fun to shoot people    george schultz  the reagan era secretary of state who called the sandinista government in nicaragua  a cancer in our own land mass  that must be  cut out   and karl eikenberry  a retired army lieutenant general who commanded u s  forces in afghanistan  years ago    with further commentary from a handful of mostly conservative academicians above all the nationalist texas a m historian elizabeth cobbs   author of a book on which the documentary is based    american umpire  portrays  and  century u s  foreign policy as nothing more than a noble effort to selflessly provide welcome and fair rules and discipline on the rest of a childish  dangerous and reckless planet  think  lord of the flies   that lacks the exceptional historical experience bequeathed to u s  leaders by the nation s far seeing founding fathers  the only substantive criticism of u s  foreign policy in  american umpire  is the complaint  voiced by numerous interview subjects  that america harms itself to the benefit of others  the europeans above all  by taking upon its shoulders too much of the burden of benevolently policing the planet  we are just too good for our own good   our real task  there is not space here to discuss in responsible detail the epic historical deletions and distortions this narrative imposes  the omissions are staggering  they range from the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of filipinos resisting u s  imperial invasion and occupation at the last century s outset to the restoration of de facto slavery in haiti and the dominican republic after world war i  the unnecessary atom bombing of hiroshima and  even worse  of nagasaki  really the first shots of the cold war    the toppling of more than  governments by u s  coups and invasions since the end of world war ii  the liquidation of perhaps as many as  million southeast asians in the so called vietnam war between  and   the cold war era sponsorship of third world fascism from chile to south africa and indonesia  the attempted assassinations of fidel castro and numerous cia directed terror bombings in socialist cuba  the near instigation of global thermonuclear war on at least three occasions  the development and sponsorship of osama bin laden and other radically arch reactionary  jihadist muslim  paramilitary forces to fight the cold war against the soviet union in afghanistan  the  highway of death   when u s  warplanes engaged in an aerial traffic jam as they rushed to slaughter tens of thousands of surrendered iraqi troops retreating from iraq in   the coordination and sponsorship of a mass murderous civil war on peasants  workers and intellectuals  with a death toll well into the many hundreds of thousands  in central america during the  and   the disastrous u s  invasion of iraq  responsible for at least  million iraqi deaths   the calamitous u s  toppling of the libyan gadhafi regime  the calamitous destabilization of the syrian regime  the u s  funding and encouragement of civil war in central africa  the enablement and protection of a vicious right wing coup in honduras in the spring and summer of   the criminal u s  global war of terror  replete with rampant  targeted assassinations   torture  illegal renditions  endless drone war and special forces killing operations across the muslim world and other places as well    american umpire  hides these horrific transgressions and the imperial calculations behind much of u s  foreign policy past and present  as numerous key u s  planning documents reveal over and over  the goal of that policy was to maintain and  if necessary  install governments that  favor private investment of domestic and foreign capital  production for export  and the right to bring profits out of the country   given the united states  remarkable possession of half the world s capital after world war ii  washington elites had no doubt that u s  investors and corporations would profit the most  internally  the basic  selfish  national and imperial objectives were openly and candidly discussed  as the  liberal  and  dovish  imperialist  top state department planner and key cold war architect george f  kennan explained in policy planning study   a critical  document   we have about   of the world s wealth  but only    of its population    in this situation  we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment  our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity    to do so  we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day dreaming      the less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans  the better    the necessity of dispensing with  human rights  and other  sentimental  and  unreal objectives  was especially pressing in the  global south   washington assigned the vast periphery of the world economic  capitalist  system africa  latin america  southeast asia and the energy rich and thus strategically hypersignificant middle east a less than flattering role  it was to  fulfill its major function as a source of raw materials and a market    actual state department language   for the great industrial  capitalist  nations  excluding  socialist  russia and its satellites   it was to be exploited both for the benefit of u s  corporations investors and for the reconstruction of europe and japan as prosperous u s  trading and investment partners organized on properly capitalist principles that were hostile to the soviet bloc    democracy  was fine as a slogan and benevolent  idealistic sounding mission statement when it came to marketing this core  underlying  ultra imperialist u s  policy at home and abroad  because most people in the  third world  had no interest in neocolonial subordination and subscribed to what u s  intelligence officials considered the heretical  idea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people   what post world war ii u s  planners called  communism    washington s real life commitment to popular governance abroad was strictly qualified  to say the least   democracy  was suitable to the u s  as long as its outcomes comported with the interests of u s  investors corporations and related u s  geopolitical objectives  it had to be abandoned  undermined and or crushed when it threatened those investors corporations and the broader imperatives of business rule to any significant degree  as president richard nixon s coldblooded national security adviser henry kissinger explained in june   three years before the u s  sponsored a fascist coup that overthrew chile s democratically elected leftist president salvador allende   i don t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people    the selfish imperial cynicism of u s  foreign policy continues to this day  into the post cold war and post   era  as leading dutch political scientists bastiaann van apeldoorn and nana de graaff write in their important new volume    american grand strategy and corporate elite networks  the open door since the end of the cold war    from the end of the  nineteenth century onward  american grand strategy has pursued a liberal expansionism aimed at the creation of a global hegemony premised upon open   free  markets  to which global capital and  above all  u s  transnational capital has full access    the global open door has continued to define the ends of the american grand strategy throughout the post cold war era   because as during and before the cold war s end  washington s commitment to  democracy  and  human rights  is conditional and hypocritical  the noble principles are fine insofar as they serve the free market hegemony of global and especially u s  transnational capital  they are dispensed with  even as u s  policymakers trumpet them  when they do not ,0
6332,8622,Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy     : Information, anti trump protesters are tools of the oligarchy  reform always provokes rage on the part of those who profit by the old order   arthur m  schlesinger  jr   the crisis of the old order by paul craig roberts  who are the anti trump protesters besmirching the name of progressives by pretending to be progressives and by refusing to accept the outcome of the presidential election  they look like  and are acting worse than  the  white trash  that they are denouncing  i think i know who they are  they are thugs for hire and are paid by the oligarchy to delegitimize trump s presidency in the way that washington and the german marshall fund paid students in kiev to protest the democratically elected ukrainian government in order to prepare the way for a coup  the organization  change org  which claims to be a progressive group  but might be a front  along with other progressive groups  for the oligarchy  is destroying the reputation of all progressives by circulating a petition that directs the electors of the electoral collage to annul the election by casting their votes for hillary  remember how upset progressives were when trump said he might not accept the election result if there was evidence that the vote was rigged  now progressives are doing what they damned trump for saying he might do under certain conditions  the western presstitutes used the protests in kiev to delegitimize a democratically elected government and to set it up for a coup  the protest pay was good enough that non ukrainians came from nearby countries to participate in the protest in order to collect the money  at the time i posted the amounts paid daily to protesters  reports came in to me from eastern and western europe from people who were not ukrainian but were paid to protest as if they were ukrainians  the same thing is going on with the trump protests  cnn reports that  for many americans across the country  donald trump s victory is an outcome they simply refuse to accept  tens of thousands filled the streets in at least  us cities overnight   this is the exact reporting that the oligarchy desired from its presstitutes and got  i hope no one thinks that simultaneous protests in  cities were a spontaneous event  how did  independent protests manage to come up with the same slogans and the same signs on the same night following the election  what is the point of the protests  and what interest is served by them  as the romans always asked   who benefits   there is only one answer  the oligarchy and only the oligarchy benefits  trump is a threat to the oligarchy  because he intends to stop the giveaway of american jobs to foreigners  the jobs giveaway  sanctified by the neoliberal junk economists as  free trade   is one of the main reasons for the  century worsening of the us income distribution  money that was formerly paid in middle class wages and salaries to american manufacturing employees and college graduates has been re routed to the pockets of the one percent  when us corporations move their production of goods and services sold to americans offshore to asian countries  such as china and india  their wage bill falls  the money formerly paid in middle class incomes goes instead into executive bonuses and dividends and capital gains to shareholders  the ladders of upward mobility that had made america the land of opportunity were dismantled for the sole purpose of making a handful of people multi billionaires  trump is a threat to the oligarchy  because he intends peaceful relations with russia  in order to replace the profitable soviet threat  the oligarchy and their neoconservative agents worked overtime to recreate the  russian threat  by demonizing russia  accustomed to many decades of excess profits from the profitable cold war  the military security complex was angry when president reagan brought the cold war to an end  before these leaches on american taxpayers could get the cold war going again  the soviet union collapsed as a result of a right wing coup against soviet president mikhail gorbachev  the military security complex and their zionist neoconservative agents cooked up  the war on terror  to keep the money flowing to the one percent  but as hard as the presstitute media worked to create fear of  the muslim threat   even insouciant americans knew that the muslims did not have thousands of icbms carrying powerful thermo nuclear weapons capable of destroying the entirety of the united states in a few minutes  neither did the muslims have the red army capable of overrunning all of europe in a couple of days  indeed  the muslims haven t needed an army  refugees from washington s wars enabled by europeans are overrunning europe  the excuse for the annual trillion dollar     billion   military security budget was missing  so the oligarchy created  the new hitler  in russia  hillary was the oligarchy s principle agent for heating up the new cold war  hillary is the tool  enriched by the oligarchy  whose job as president was to protect and to increase the trillion dollar budget of the military security complex  with hillary in the white house  the looting of the american taxpayers in behalf of the wealth of the one percent could go forward unimpeded  but if trump resolves  the russian threat   the oligarchy takes an income hit  hillary s job as president was also to privatize social security in order that her wall street benefactors can rip off americans the way that americans have been ripped off by the insurance companies under obamacare  those americans who do not pay attention think  mistakenly  that the fbi cleared hillary of violating national security protocols with her email practices  the fbi said that hillary did violate national security  but that it was a result of carelessness or ignorance  she got off from indictment  because the fbi concluded that she did not intentionally violate national security protocols  the investigation of the clinton foundation continues  in other words  in order to protect hillary the fbi fell back on the ancient common law rule that  there can be no crime without intent    see pcr and lawrence stratton  the tyranny of good intentions    one would think that protesters  if they were legitimate  would be celebrating trump s victory  he  unlike hillary  promises to reduce tensions with powerful russia  and we hope also with china  unlike hillary  trump says he is concerned with the absence of careers for those very people protesting in the streets of  cities against him  in other words  the protests against the american people for electing trump as their president are pointless  the protests are happening for one reason only  the oligarchy intends to delegitimize the trump presidency  once president trump is delegitimized  it will be easier for the oligarchy to assassinate him  unless the oligarchy can appoint and control trump s government  trump is a prime candidate for assassination  the protests against trump are suspicious for another reason  unlike hillary  obama  and george w  bush  donald trump has not slaughtered and dislocated millions of peoples in seven countries  sending millions of refugees from the oligarchy s wars to overrun europe  trump earned his fortune  and if by hook or crook  not by selling us government influence to foreign agents as bill and hillary did  so what are the protesters protesting  there is no answer except that they are hired to protest  just as the maidan protesters in kiev were hired to protest by us and german financed ngos  the protests in kiev were equally pointless  because presidential elections were only months away  if ukrainians really believed that their president was conspiring with russia to keep ukraine from becoming a western puppet state and wished to become a puppet state regardless of the costs  the opportunity to vote the government out was at hand  the only reason for the protests was to orchestrate a coup  the us did succeed in putting their agent in control of the new ukrainian government as victoria nuland and the us ambassador in kiev confirmed in their telephone conversation that is available on the internet  the maidan protests were pointless except for making a coup possible  the protests were without any doubt arranged by washington through assistant secretary of state victoria nuland  a neoconservative brought into the state department by hillary clinton for the purpose of creating conflict with russia  trump is being protested in order to make him vulnerable in the event he proves to be the threat to the oligarchy that he is thought to be  trump won the presidency  but the oligarchy is still in power  which makes any real reforms difficult to achieve  symbolic reforms can be the product of the contest between president trump and the oligarchs  karl marx learned from historical experience  and lenin  stalin  and pol pot learned from karl marx  that change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them  we have proof of this throughout south america  every revolution by the indigenous people has left unmolested the spanish ruling class  and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and washington  washington has conspired with traditional elites to remove the elected presidents of honduras on a number of occasions  recently  washington helped elites evict the female presidents of argentina and brazil  the presidents of venezuela  ecuador  and bolivia are in the crosshairs and are unlikely to survive  washington is determined to get its hands on julian assange  to achieve this washington intends to overthrow the ecuadoran government that  in defiance of washington  gave julian assange political asylum  hugo chavez had the power to exile or to exterminate the spanish ruling class in venezuela when the ruling class participated in a cia coup against chavez  but before the cia could kill chavez  the people and the military forced his release  instead of punishing the criminals who would have murdered him  chavez let them go  according to marx  lenin  and stalin  this is the classic mistake of the revolutionary  to rely on good will from the overthrown ruling class is the certain road to the defeat of the revolution  latin american has proved itself unable to learn this lesson  revolutions cannot be conciliatory  trump is a dealmaker  the oligarchy can permit him the sheen of success in exchange for no real change  trump is not perfect  he might fail on his own  but we should back him on the two most important elements in his program  to reduce tensions between the major nuclear powers  and to halt washington s policy of permitting globalism to destroy americans  economic prospects  if tensions between nuclear powers worsen  we won t be here to worry about other problems  the combination of the economy hollowed out by globalism and immigration is an economic nightmare  that trump understands this is reason to support him  note  some believe that trump is a ruse conducted by the oligarchy  however  as hillary is the bought and paid for representative of the oligarchy  such an elaborate ruse is unnecessary  it is preferable for the oligarchy to win on its own platform than to install a president on the opposite platform and then change him around  another sellout increases the anger of the people  if hillary had won  the oligarchy would have had the voters  mandate for their platform  dr  paul craig roberts was assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy and associate editor of the wall street journal  he was columnist for business week  scripps howard news service  and creators syndicate  he has had many university appointments  his internet columns have attracted a worldwide following  roberts  latest books are the failure of laissez faire capitalism and economic dissolution of the west   how america was lost   and the neoconservative threat to world order  ,0

african union on monday in an effort to address the worsening situation in south sudan  even as he met with ethiopia s prime minister to discuss how to strengthen human rights and democratic institutions here   with no resolution in sight for the ongoing conflict in south sudan  obama brought together top officials from ethiopia  uganda  kenya  sudan and the a u  to chart out a strategy in the event that the latest round of peace talks fail   african nations  led by ethiopia  have been trying to broker a peace in south sudan through the intergovernmental authority on development  igad   a regional body  and are almost ready to present a possible compromise to the warring parties  the two sides will have until aug   to respond to the proposal  but administration officials have little expectation that they will accept it   on monday  obama praised the regional leaders for showing  extraordinary leadership in trying to address the continuing situation in south sudan   the group included ethiopian prime minister hailemariam desalegn  ugandan president yoweri museveni  kenyan president uhuru kenyatta  african union chairperson dlamini zuma and sudan s minister of foreign affairs  ibrahim ghandour    this gives me and the u s  delegation an opportunity to learn from them what progress has been made  where there appears to be continued roadblocks and how we can partner with them to make progress   obama said   our hope is that we can actually bring about the kind of peace that the people of south sudan so desperately need    the question of south sudan   a nation that the united states helped bring into existence in  after years of effort by both the george w  bush and obama administrations   has vexed american policymakers for years   in december   south sudan president salva kiir accused riek machar  who had served as his vice president  of attempting a coup d etat  the two had been longtime political rivals from different ethnic groups   kiir is dinka  machar is a nuer   who had come together to form a government when the country was first created   while tribal differences have helped fuel the conflict  the war has been largely focused on control of the nation s oil fields  south sudan s primary source of revenue   princeton lyman  u s  special envoy for sudan and south sudan from  to   noted that when he first took over as envoy  the united states had spent   billion on peacekeeping and other assistance for the two nations   and that was four years ago  this is a big investment   he added   at this point  more than   million people are facing food shortages  while roughly   million are displaced from their homes  an additional   south sudanese have fled across the border into neighboring countries  including ethiopia   the conflict also poses a major economic problem for kenya  which had major investments in south sudan before the fighting broke out  the lapsset corridor project was aimed at transporting oil from south sudan to the kenyan port of lamu  and according to e j  hogendoorn  deputy program director for africa at the international crisis group  the planned transportation and infrastructure development could have been an  engine of development  for many parts of east africa   unfortunately  of course  that s on hold because of the war   he said   while obama spent part of the afternoon addressing a regional conflict in africa  he devoted the rest of the day to strengthening ties with ethiopia  whose alliance with the united states dates back more than a century  but the current government has come under sharp criticism for its treatment of political opponents and journalists   obama is the first sitting u s  president to visit ethiopia   in a news conference monday afternoon  both obama and hailemariam said they had a frank discussion about ethiopia s human rights practices and the need for improvement  ethiopia is africa s number two jailer of journalists  according to the committee to protect journalists  and its ruling party won  percent of the seats in may s parliamentary elections   white house national security adviser susan rice  asked last week whether she considered ethiopia a democracy  replied  with irony   one hundred percent    but during the news conference obama twice referred to the ethiopian government as  democratically elected     i don t bite my tongue   obama said of raising concerns on these issues with ethiopia   but i do so from a position of respect    hailemariam  for his part  said   our commitment to democracy is real  not skin deep    but he added later that people could not expect sweeping reforms given the fact that military rule ended just a couple of decades ago   something has to be understood  this is a fledgling democracy    the two leaders also discussed their collaboration on counterterrorism  an area in which ethiopia has been an active leader  the white house announced monday it will  work with congress to provide approximately   million  this year in new training  equipment and capacity building aid to its african allies   the administration also said it would provide at least   million in assistance this fiscal year to combat violent extremism in east africa  the money is intended to foster collaboration among security forces  law enforcement  government officials  community leaders and members of civil society  officials said   obama praised ethiopia s work to curb extremist activity but noted that its government had labeled some opposition groups as posing a greater threat than u s  intelligence would indicate   our intelligence indicates while they may oppose the government  they have not tipped into terrorism   he said   the united states provides more than   million in assistance to ethiopia annually  the vast bulk of that     million   comes from the u s  agency for international development  while the rest is largely security related  last fiscal year  nearly   million went to health programs  while   million went to humanitarian aid   obama said ethiopia  has proven itself a global leader  on development and over the past  years  has lifted millions of people out of poverty     to many people around the world  their image of ethiopia remains stuck in the past  remembering drought and famine   he said   the two leaders appeared to have a friendly rapport throughout the news conference  hailemariam described his country as scoring a series of firsts  along with being  the cradle of mankind   he said   ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee   that elicited a smile from obama   obama said he was impressed by the ethiopian s unusual pets   i had a chance to see the famous lions that live on the grounds   he said   i m considering getting some for the white house   but he conceded that before he did that   i ll have to make sure my dogs are safe  ,1
